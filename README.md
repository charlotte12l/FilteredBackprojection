# FilteredBackprojection

I wrote two versions (MATLAB & C++) to implement the Filtered Backprojection Algorithm

## 1. MATLAB
This is the overview of GUI. There are 5 modules:![](https://github.com/charlotte12l/FilteredBackprojection/blob/master/GUI_overview.png) 

### 1.1 Read Image
· Click "Shepp Logan" to open a standard Shepp Logan model
· Click "other image" to read other pictures from the computer, which will be automatically converted to single channel gray-scale image.

### 1.2 Projection
· After reading the picture, we should use the projection module for radon transformation.  

· First, enter the number of projection angles at the projection number.      

After that, click "projection", the software executes the projection program, and displays the projection process and results in a white box.

### 1.3 Filtering
After the projection, enter the filter module and choose different filters to process the projection function.
After selecting the filter, click "Filtering" to obtain the filtered projection function image in the white box.

### 1.4 Reconstruction
After filtering, click "Reconstruction" to realize reconstruction

### 1.5 Reconstruction Evaluation
After reconstruction, click "reconstruction evaluation" to calculate and display the normalized mean square distance criterion D and normalized average absolute distance criterion R.

### Result
This is the result of using the GUI for shepp logan.![](https://github.com/charlotte12l/FilteredBackprojection/blob/master/GUI_sample.png)
